# esx-inventoryhud
All working inventory hud which are taken offline
I did not make any of these scripts. I do not take any credits.

I uploaded this because multiple inventory huds are taken offline due to server overload.

If you are running a server for 32 users, than you can use this amazing inventroy for your server.
